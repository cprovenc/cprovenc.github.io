Article Description
<p>To determine how thermal environments affect the evolution of different enzyme structural classes, Lockwood and Somero (2012) analyzed the effects of temperature on the kinetic properties (Km) of five enzyme orthologs in the warm adapted Mytilus galloprovincialis and cold adapted M. trossulus. Km values differed only for one enzyme, IDH, showing the warm adapted IDH ortholog had a higher binding affinity (lower Km), increasing its thermal stable to cope with their naturally warmer habitat. The increased thermal stability results from two amino acid substitutions in M. galloprovincialis’-IDH ortholog, providing two extra hydrogen bonds to the orthologs mobile region for additional stability when undergoing catalysis. Lockwood and Somero’s, 2012 findings highlight how temperature adaptation can arise due to minimal changes in a peptides sequence, rates of ligand binging and catalysis differ between protein classes and congeners protein orthologs, and demonstrate the importance of analyzing protein function and global stability to draw a more complete picture of how thermal adaption occurs.</p>
