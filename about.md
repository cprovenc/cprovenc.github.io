<p>Hello! My name is Curtis, the aspiring Zoologist and Evolutionary Biologist. I am currently a senior attending the University of Vermont, graduating in May 2016 with a B.S. in Zoology and a minor in Chemistry. During my undergraduate career, I have been conducting research in <a href="http://shelmscahan.github.io/">Dr. Helms-Cahan's</a> laboratory with the guidance of Ph.D candidate, Andrew Nguyen. We are conducting research on how the common woodland ant <i>Aphaenogaster</i> will be impacted by warmer temperatures as part of a long-term forest warming experiment in Harvard Forest, Massachusetts and Duke Forest, North Carolina. To better assess how <i>Aphaenogaster</i> will react to climate change, we propose measuring the gene expression levels of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) to serve as a proxy for sub-lethal stress.</p>



<p>  
 Ecology, genetics, and evolution have been academic interests of mine throughout my academic career. I plan to purse higher education and research how certain traits have evolved to interact with an organisms environment and how these traits will function or, if possible, adapt, in response to a changing world. 
</p>

<p>Through my research I have gained ecological knowledge of how species may respond to environmental cues and molecular techniques to approach such questions. Also, running my own data analyses have given me basic computational skills in R that I hope to expand by performing further research. Now, I hope to extend my training to learn how different environmental conditions impact marine ecosystems and their invertebrates? behaviors by identifying specific genes associated with traits and tracing how they arose through phylogenetic analyses and transcriptome sequencing experiments.</p>
